# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification

Thrilled to share my latest deep learning project: **Cat vs Dog Image Classification!**

This project uses the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning** with the **pre-trained VGG16 model** in TensorFlow Keras to build a robust classifier that efficiently distinguishes between cats and dogs.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- ✅ Used **VGG16** architecture to extract meaningful features from images.
- 📈 Achieved **high accuracy and recall**, ensuring reliable predictions.
- 🛠️ Applied **fine-tuning** to adapt the model specifically for our dataset.
- 🙌 Huge thanks to [@CodeXcue](https://lnkd.in/djW4FY_Q) for the valuable support and guidance.
